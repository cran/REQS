Description: Contains the function run.eqs() which calls an EQS script file, executes the EQS estimation, and, finally, imports the results as R objects. These two steps can be performed separately: call.eqs() calls and executes EQS, whereas read.eqs() imports existing EQS outputs as objects into R. It requires EQS 6.2 (build 98 or higher).
